# GameHub Web Project

## The most valuable and updated videos will posted here with description and url to their delicates trailers. All description will be sourced from STEAM or their relevant promotion page.  Trailers are all url implemented using anchor (ie. <a href=…>) to YOUTUBE. 

To reunite with our visitors we offer a little support page utilising form elements and built-in JavaScript functions.

In addition to basic JS functions, we applied various forms elements allowing us to collect visitors information in a confidential manner for research and future collaboration purpose (<input type=“password”…>). 

Aside from all the exciting and newly built functions. We also value viewers and gamers opinions on the latest games and trend.  As list of games will be regularly updated with a built in poll beneath allowing visitors to express their opinion and game of choice. 

## One of the most challenging yet achievable technique is creating responsive web design (RWD). We have altered both HTML and mainly CSS source code to adapt 2 different resolutions; when width length is smaller or equal to 800px and 600px, respectively. We have taken these 2 resolutions targeting general tablet and smart phone sizes. Responsive web design is important for several reasons:

### •improving user experience; accommodate  users with different size of devices
### •future proof our website; in the case newly invented devices and browsers plugin. Our website would able to adapt the unseeable.

Last but not least, all artworks are researched from the internet. Some fonts design are exempted by self-written using CSS codes (eg. {Transform:…; padding:…}).

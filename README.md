# GameHub Web Project

## Overview

GameHub Web Project is a platform showcasing valuable and updated videos with detailed descriptions and links to their trailers.  
- Descriptions are sourced from STEAM or relevant promotion pages.  
- Trailers are linked using anchor tags (e.g., `<a href=...>`) to YouTube.

## Features

1. **Support Page**  
   - A dedicated support page using form elements and built-in JavaScript functions.  
   - Various form elements are implemented to collect visitors' information confidentially for research and future collaboration purposes (e.g., `<input type="password"...>`).  

2. **Engaging Polls**  
   - Visitors can express their opinions and preferences for the latest games and trends.  
   - A list of games is regularly updated with a built-in poll to enhance interactivity.

3. **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**  
   - Alterations to HTML and CSS enable the website to adapt to different resolutions, particularly targeting tablets and smartphones (width â‰¤ 800px and 600px).  
   - Importance of RWD:  
     - **Improves user experience**: Accommodates users with devices of various sizes.  
     - **Future-proofs the website**: Ensures adaptability to new devices and browser plugins.  

## Artworks and Fonts  

- All artworks are researched from the internet.  
- Some font designs are self-created using CSS codes (e.g., `{Transform:...; padding:...}`).
